is the provisioner extension point in UI or Core?
The new provisioners extension point lives in the UI plug-in, but its namespace is in the org.eclipse.pde.core plug-in.

Also, I suggest renaming it to targetProvisioners.  

For the New and Noteworthy, I called it 'org.eclipse.pde.ui.targetProvisioners'
