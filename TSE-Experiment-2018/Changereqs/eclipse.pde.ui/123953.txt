Have Error Log view's Open Log use Eclipse's file association
It'd be really nice if the Open Log function in the Error Log view used an Eclipse File Association that's bound to *.log instead of simply opening in the OS's associated editor.  This would allow the log file to be opened in a text editor within Eclipse, or bound to an external editor other than the OS default.
