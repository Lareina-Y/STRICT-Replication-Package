Bug 382701 – [1.8][compiler] Implement semantic analysis of Lambda expressions & Reference expressions.
This ER will serve as the top level umbrella entry to track semantic
analysis support for Lambda expressions & Method and constructor references.
(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380501 will be used to
track support for default methods.)
Separate bugs will be spawned for unit tasks in this project and linked
to this entry.
When resolved, we would be able to reject every semantically illegal program
with a suitable/appropriate diagnostic.
The further treatment of well
defined programs will be the subject matter of ERs that will be created
later.
