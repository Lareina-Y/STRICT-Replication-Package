37736 – LoggerEventListener's appenderRemovedEvent() and levelChangedEvent() methods are never called
Despite registering a LoggerEventListener with a LoggerRepository/Hierarchy, the
appenderRemovedEvent() and levelChangedEvent() methods are never called.
 This
is very frustrating and misleading.
 [log4j 1.2 has the same issue with its
equivalent listener and event for appender removal...]
In log4j 1.3 at least this is due purely to the lack of a few lines of code in
Category to call the approach "fire" methods on Hierarchy.
I am attaching a patch which adds the necessary calls.
