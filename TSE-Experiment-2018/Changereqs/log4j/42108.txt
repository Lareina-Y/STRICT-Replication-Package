42108 – LoggingEvent accessors compatible with log4j 1.3
Chainsaw (and potentially other log4j 1.3 clients) have LoggingEvent.getTimeStamp,
LoggingEvent.getProperty(Stirng), LoggingEvent.getProperties() etc and other accessors that could be
supported on log4j 1.2.
Chainsaw and XMLDecoder currently uses LoggingEvent mutators that would require dropping final
qualifiers on many member variablesto support on log4j 1.2.
 Instead of doing that, I've added another
LoggingEvent constructor that handles the same use pattern to both log4j 1.2 and log4j 1.3 branches.
