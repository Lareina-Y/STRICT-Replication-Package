42099 – ExpressionFilter backport
This enhancement extracts the org.apache.log4j.filter.ExpressionFilter and o.a.l.filter.LocationInfoFilter
from log4j 1.3 and adapts it to work with log4j 1.2.
 The initial goal is to support Chainsaw on log4j 1.2,
however hopefully the resulting package can be used by log4j 1.2.x users who would like to use the
ExpressionFilter.
