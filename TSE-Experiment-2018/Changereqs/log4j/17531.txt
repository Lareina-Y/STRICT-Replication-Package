17531 – PropertyConfigurator.configureAndWatch() don't reset the configuration
When the log4j properties file is changed only  added logger are taken into
account, removed logger are still enabled.
I mean that if a logger is drop down
from debug to warn it still prints debugging information after the log4j
properties file has been saved.
This is because in class PropertyWatchdog in doOnChange() method the
configuration is not reset before reading the changed one -> Here is a
correction that works fine for me:
public
void doOnChange() {
LoggerRepository hierarchy = LogManager.getLoggerRepository();
hierarchy.resetConfiguration();
new PropertyConfigurator().doConfigure(filename,hierarchy);
}
