41373 – T113 causes the build to fail
This is probably a know issue but couldn't find any reference to it, there is a
class (T113) inside src/org/apache/log4j/test/serialization/T that causes the
build to fail, because it references the now non-existant priority field on
LoggingEvent.
Should this class even exist, it has a default package.
PROOF:
Hashtable eventToHashtable(LoggingEvent event) {
Hashtable ht = new Hashtable();
ht.put("categoryName", event.categoryName);
ht.put("renderedMessage", event.getRenderedMessage());
ht.put("priorityStr", event.priority.toString());
ht.put("throwableInfo", event.getThrowableInformation());
return ht;
}
