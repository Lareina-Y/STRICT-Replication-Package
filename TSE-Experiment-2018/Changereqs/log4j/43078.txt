43078 – Optionally render MDC content in XMLLayout
The log4j 1.3 XMLLayout would generate a log4j:properties element that contains MDC and
LoggerRepository content.
 This bug provides the same capability in log4j 1.2.
 It is disabled by default as
unexpected content may cause apps that consume the existing content to fail.
 To enable output of MDC
values, call layout.setProperties(true) or the equivalent configuration.
