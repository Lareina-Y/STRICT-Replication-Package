log4j 1.2.14 release
I've scanned the bug list and tried to address all the bug reports that are only
a few lines and fix an obvious problem.  I'm inclined to add the
SyslogAppender.setPort() method, but I'm hesitant to add the
SyslogAppender.setFacility(int) since it might have repercussions with the
configurators.  If there are any bug reports that you think should go into a
log4j 1.2.14 release, please mention them on the log4j-dev list or add them to
the "Depends On" list.
