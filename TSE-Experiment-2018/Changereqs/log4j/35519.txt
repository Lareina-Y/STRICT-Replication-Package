35519 – log4j 1.2 unit tests fail on later JDKs and Ant
The log4j 1.2.x unit tests fail on later JDK's and versions of Ant since the witness files contained stack
traces containing levels within the JDK and Ant implementation.
 The bug ports over the SunReflectFilter
and JunitTestRunnerFilter from log4j 1.3.x which strip off some internal JDK and Ant entries from the call
stack.
