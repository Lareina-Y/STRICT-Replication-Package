Thanks for the info.
I reviewed the bug information too.
I'm still not
sure what to do next.
I'm using the following pattern in my Logging.properties file
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, stdout
log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %d{yyyy.MM.dd
HH:mm:ss,SSS}{GMT} Z [%t] %c{1} - %m%n
and this is what I get in the log file
INFO  2007.01.04 07:47:45,454{GMT} Z .
.
.
Where the time is definitely not GMT.
We're using Java 1.4.2_12 as a
runtime.
The 1.4.2 javadoc seems to indicate that GMT is an acceptable
timezone.
It looks as though PatternLayout is not recognizing the second
set of braces after %d{yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss,SSS}
