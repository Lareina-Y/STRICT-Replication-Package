23202 – l7dlog() methods do not support FQCN of wrapper classes.
The l7dlog() methods, unlike the standard log() methods, do not support the
passing of a fully-qualified class name into the logger.
 As a result, the
Logger class utilizes the FQCN initialized and stored in the base Category
class.
Recommend adding a l7dlog() method with a similar signature as the generic log
() method.
