30950 – Add Logger l7dlog methods without Throwable args
I am porting from our own logging to log4j and I now pass nulls all over the
place.
How about adding:
public void l7dlog(
Level level, String key, Object[] params)
public void l7dlog(
Level level, String key)
BTW, l7dlog is a pretty poor name IMO.
Plain "log" would be fine or
"logLocalized".
"l7d" to save 4 letters when I am already using isLogInfoEnabled
(which is a nice obvious name)?
Thanks.
