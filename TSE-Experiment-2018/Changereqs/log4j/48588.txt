48588 – DOMConfigurator does not close input stream when configured based on URL
DOMConfigurator.doConfigure(final URL url, LoggerRepository repository) opens the configuration file using the equivalent of url.openConnection().getInputStream()).
 However, that input stream is never closed.
In some situations, when DOMConfigurator.configure(URL) is invoked multiple times, it leads to
java.io.FileNotFoundException: log4j.xml (Too many open files (errno:24))
