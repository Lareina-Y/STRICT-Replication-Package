35568 – log4j 1.2 unit tests have stray imports and test order change
When attempting to use the log4j 1.2 unit tests against the CVS HEAD (the future 1.3), several tests fail to
compile due to unnecessary imports of org.apache.log4j.performance.NullAppender and
org.apache.log4j.LocationInfo.
Three classes will fail to compile against log4j 1.3, MyPatternLayout, MyPatternParser and DRFATestCase.
DRFATestCase is a test of the internal implementation of the inner class RollingCalendar which is only
visible within the org.apache.log4j package which does not make a test of the external log4j API.
MyPatternLayout and MyPatternParser do test the publically exposed extension points for PatternLayout
and PatternParser.
 These classes have been radically changed do not expose the same extension points.
These tests are valid and need to be considered as version compatibility becomes closer.
