38024 – Layout not compatible between 1.2 and 1.3
The abstract method format changed signatures from String format(LoggingEvent event) in log4j 1.2 to
format(Writer output, LoggingEvent event) in log4j 1.3 which means than any existing log4j 1.2 user
supplied Layout will not longer compile and will likely result in a MethodNotFound if the new format
method is called on a previous compiled.
 Also HTMLFormat appears to be missing from 1.3.
