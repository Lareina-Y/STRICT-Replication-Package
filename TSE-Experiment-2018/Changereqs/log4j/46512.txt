CategoryPath doesn't replace slashes to dots
Running FindBugs on log4j sources -- as part of preparing lecture, in fact -- revealed a bug in org.apache.log4j.lf5.viewer.categoryexplorer.CategoryPath.

In line 64 there is a code

  processedCategory.replace('/', '.');

and FindBugs correctly recognizes the error there as the result of replacement is ignored. The line should be

  processedCategory = processedCategory.replace('/', '.');
