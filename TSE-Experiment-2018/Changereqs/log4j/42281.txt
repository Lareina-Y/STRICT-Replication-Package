42281 – Unit tests fail on java-gcj and JRockit
Slight differences in the contents of stack traces cause the unit tests to fail when run under gcj.
 The "at"
lines in stack traces are preceded by spaces in GCJ where the expectation is that there is an initial tab
character.
 Also, libgcj.so.7 appears in places where the tests expected either Compiled Code or Native
Code.
