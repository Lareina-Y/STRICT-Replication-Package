35831 – log4j 1.2 does not build on JDK 1.5
javac tasks specify the bytecode target as 1.1 but do not specify the java source language version.
 The
JDK 1.5's javac's default source version is "1.5" and it does not support creating JDK 1.1 bytecode from
JDK 1.5 source.
 If the source is specified as "1.3", then the compiler will not accept any JDK 1.4 (assert)
or JDK 1.5 (generics) specific constructs and can generate JDK 1.1 compatible bytecode.
In addition, some of Java Management Extensions are included in JDK 1.5, but not the
"com.sun.jdmk.comm.HtmlAdaptorServer" from the unsupported jmxtools.jar.
 I've modified the
determination of jmx-available to require the previous marker class and HtmlAdaptorServer to be
available.
The serialization of exceptions seemed to be slightly changed (but possibly not in an incompatible way)
and I lower the point at which testSerializationWithException stops comparing against the witness.
