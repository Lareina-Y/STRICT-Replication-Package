[SLING-1281] Copy Move operations dont work. - ASF JIRA
To reproduce:  
 Create 2 content items:  
  
 curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/d1 -u admin:admin 
 curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/d2 -u admin:admin 
 
 Attempt to copy one item on top of the other:  
  
 curl -F ":operation=copy" -F ":dest=d2" http://localhost:8080/d1 -u admin:admin 
 
 Correctly encounter: 412 "Cannot copy JcrNodeResource, type=nt:unstructured, path=/d1 to /d2: destination exists"  
 Attempt to copy one item on top of the other with :replace set to true:  
  
 curl -F ":operation=copy" -F ":dest=d2" -F ":replace=true" http://localhost:8080/d1 -u admin:admin 
 
 This should now succeed, however, it is returning:  
 500 javax.jcr.PathNotFoundException: /d2  
 and we know for sure /d2 exists!  
 I think this might be related to changes in the pooling.
