[SLING-5025] Make ResourceResolver methods throw ISE in case the according factory is unregistered - ASF JIRA
In SLING-4360 the ResourceResolver.isLive() method was extended to check if the ResourceResolverFactory has been unregistered in the mean time.
That check should be done in addition for every method on the resource resolver and should throw an ISE in case the factory is no longer registered.
