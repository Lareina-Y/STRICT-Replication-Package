[SLING-1619] attempting to automatically set a protected property shouldn't cause a failure - ASF JIRA
this: 
 curl -u admin:admin "-Fjcr:created=" "-Fjcr:primaryType=sling:Folder" http://localhost:8888/test/content/folder 
 currently returns an error because jcr:created is a protected property in nt:hierarchyNode.

 We should just skip this property
