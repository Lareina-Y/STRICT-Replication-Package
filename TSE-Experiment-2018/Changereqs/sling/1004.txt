[SLING-1004] The folder where Sling servlets store their configuration should be configurable at deployment - ASF JIRA
Integrating Sling as an external off-the-shelf component should be made as simple as possible, especially in web containers.
 Today, when using the launchpad webapp, to configure the folder where Sling servlets will store their configuration, one as to open the war, change a file (either sling.properties or web.xml) and repack.

 This is impractical for the following reasons: 
  
 it prevents Sling webapp war to be upgraded by simply replacing the war 
 it places the responsibility of the environment configuration solely on the development team whereas in some organization this is the responsibility of another team 
 it does not enable easy change of the configuration to follow environmental constraints (eg.
Windows/*nix)
