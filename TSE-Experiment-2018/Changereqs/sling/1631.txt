[SLING-1631] Classloading problems when taglibs are used. - ASF JIRA
When taglibs are used together with jsp scripting there are several problems:  1.
The taglib cache does not detect changes to taglibs (contained in bundles) like the general classloading mechanism through the dynamic classloader - this can result in inconsistencies and classloading problems.
 2.
The last modified check for taglibs does not work as expected.
As soon as tags are used, they are considered as changed which results in recompilation of the jsp and of the tag where the second invalidates the classloader of the jsp.
This classloader is later on used and then a classloading exception is thrown
