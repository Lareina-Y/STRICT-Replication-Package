[SLING-5189] Improve start level handling when merging models - ASF JIRA
If two models containing the same artifact with different start levels are merged, currently the start level of the overlaying model wins.
 However, if the base model defines a start level and the overlaying model just uses the default start level, the resulting model should have the start level of the base model.
The same would happen if the model would be applied at runtime as default start level means no start level information.
