[SLING-5207] ResourceResolver.isResourceType leads to endless loop when resourceSuperType hierarchy is cyclic - ASF JIRA
although illegal it is technically possible to create two resources which superResourceType hierarchy creates cycles pointing to each other directly or indirectly.

 with the current implementation of ResourceResolver.isResourceType this leads to an endless loop.
the implementation should detect such and error and throw an exception.
