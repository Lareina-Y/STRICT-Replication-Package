[SLING-1847] Redirect after logout does not work with form authentication - ASF JIRA
The redirectAfterLogout method of org.apache.sling.auth.core.impl.SlingAuthenticator is looking for a request attribute or parameter named "resource" to decide where to redirect after logout.

 But, if there is a request parameter named "resource" on the request, the request never makes it to the LogoutServlet because the authenticationSucceeded method of the FormAuthenticationHandler is also looking for a request parameter with the same name and immediately redirecting to the specified resource which terminates the rest of the request processing.
The user is never logged out before redirecting to the resource.
