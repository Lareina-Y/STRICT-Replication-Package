[SLING-4944] JcrResourceBundleProvider: Potential race condition between setting the resourceResolver and using it - ASF JIRA
After fixing SLING-4910 there is still a very slim chance that the resource resolver is being null while being used within the scheduleReloadBundles, because that is called, before the resolver is initialized.
The chance to see that in reality is close to zero though, because scheduleReloadBundles is using the resource resolver only in a scheduled thread.
