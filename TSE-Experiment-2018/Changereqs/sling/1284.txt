[SLING-1284] MemoryLeak: ThreadLocal variable is never cleared - ASF JIRA
The JspFactoryImpl by default uses a thread local for caching a page context pool.
This thread local is never cleared creating a memory leak.
 I think the easiest solution is to disable the pool - don't know if this has a real performance impact
