[SLING-5219] Mounting a ResourceProvider makes it impossible to create child resources under it - ASF JIRA
(I am not sure where the problem is exactly, but setting it under Servlets POST for now ).

 Consider the following scenario: 
  
 JCR provider mounted at / 
 FS provider mounted at /content/blog/images 
 No resources in the JCR repo for /content or /content/blog 
 
 A POST call to create /content or /content/blog ( I have used httpie ) fails  
 
 http --auth=admin:admin -f POST http://localhost:8080 /content 'sling\:target=/content/blog/posts' 
 
 If I remove the FS provider then the call succeeds.
