[SLING-1816] Make Sling POST Servlet dynamically configurable - ASF JIRA
Currently the SlingPostServlet is a regaular DS 1.0 component which is stopped and restarted for updated OSGi configuration.
This gives a certain amount of down-time during configuration update and also places some load on the system.

 To make configuration updates as transparent and low latency as possible, it would probably be good support the new DS 1.0 functionality for dynamic configuration update using the "modify" method.
