[SLING-2415] Ability to delete child nodes, without deleting the parent node in SlingPostServlet - ASF JIRA
Provide a way to delete all the child nodes of a given node in the SlingPostServlet, without deleting the parent node itself.

 There are many situations where one might want to delete only the child nodes, while keeping the parent node intact.
 
 One way to do this now is to use the :applyTo request parameter for each child node.
However, this requires first fetching all the child nodes, which can be avoided with this feature.
