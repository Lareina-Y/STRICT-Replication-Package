[RemoteSrvs] ServicePublicationHandler creates endpoints for loopback references
org.eclipse.ecf.internal.osgi.services.discovery.ServicePublicationHandler.serviceDiscovered(IServiceEvent) and org.eclipse.ecf.internal.osgi.services.discovery.ServicePublicationHandler.serviceUndiscovered(IServiceEvent) do not filter service ids that originate from the same runtime. This causes endpoints to be created/connected, which are never used. This is considerable overhead that should be avoided (in most scenarios)
The only scenario where this behavior is useful, is for local testing purposes. This use case however does not represent the default and hence can be activated with a system property.
