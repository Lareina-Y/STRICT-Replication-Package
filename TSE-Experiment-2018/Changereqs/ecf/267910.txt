Cannot access p2 remote repositories when behind a proxy
My computer is a Linux 64 Box running Mandriva 2009 64 bits

Installed fresh IBUILD I20090309-1800

Set proxy configuration by hand (manual):
computer.domain.fr 8080

Each access to a remote repository will throw the following exception:

Unresolved compilation problem:
