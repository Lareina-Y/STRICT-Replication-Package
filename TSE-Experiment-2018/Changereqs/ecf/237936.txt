Support compressed http (mod_gzip, mod_deflate)
When p2 talks to a web server for plain-text content (html, xml, etc), it should send the "Accept-encoding: gzip,deflate" header to the server, and handle gzipped/deflated content in return for substantial bandwidth savings for both the client and the server.

If the server does not support mod_(deflate|gzip), the uncompressed content is sent transparently.

See bug 205708, where the Mylyn Bugzilla client now supports gzippped content for its http transfers.


This request for an XML mirror list has a response size of 9,674 bytes:
www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/webtools/updates/site.xml&format=xml&countryCode=us&timeZone=-5&responseType=xml 


Using a gzip/deflate client (such as wget, and any modern browser), the same list only weighs 1,941 bytes.

wget -S --header "Accept-encoding: gzip,deflate" http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/webtools/updates/site.xml\&format=xml\&countryCode=us\&timeZone=-5\&responseType=xml
[snip some headers]
  Content-Encoding: gzip
  Content-Length: 1941

70% reduction in size is typical, and what's best is that the server admin can choose higher compression to save bandwidth, lower compression to save CPU cycles or no compression at all.
