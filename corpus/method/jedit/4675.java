//{{{ _listDirectory() method
/**
	 * A convenience method that matches file names against globs, and can
	 * optionally list the directory recursively.
	 * @param session The session
	 * @param directory The directory. Note that this must be a full
	 * URL, including the host name, path name, and so on. The
	 * username and password (if needed by the VFS) is obtained from the
	 * session instance.
	 * @param glob Only file names matching this glob will be returned
	 * @param recursive If true, subdirectories will also be listed.
	 * @param comp The component that will parent error dialog boxes
	 * @exception IOException if an I/O error occurred
	 * @param skipBinary ignore binary files (do not return them).
	 *    This will slow down the process since it will open the files
	 * @param skipHidden skips hidden files, directories, and
	 *        backup files. Ignores any file beginning with . or #, or ending with ~
	 *        or .bak
