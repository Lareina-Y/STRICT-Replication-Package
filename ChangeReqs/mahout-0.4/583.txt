Loss some data when create sequence files from directory
Loss some data when create sequence files from directory. It will happen when we need more than one output chunk file. It create chunk-0 twice. The first chunk-0 file is overwrite by the second chunk-0 file. That's because the name of the second chunk file starts from 0 not 1. For example, it creates files in the sequence, chunk-0, chunk-0, chunk-1, chunk-2, chunk-3, chunk-*. So we loss the first chunk-0 file if we create more than one chunk files.
