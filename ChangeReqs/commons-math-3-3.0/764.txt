New sample() API should accept RandomGenerator as parameter
This may come to late as I know the 3.0 release is nearing completion, but I had some concerns about the new sample() method on the math3 RealDistribution interface. Specifically, there doesn't seem to be a way to supply a random generator to the sampler. Perhaps it would be better to have a factory method on the RealDistribution interface that accepted a RandomGenerator and returns an instance of some new interface, Sampler, which contains the sample() methods. That is: interface RealDistribution { Sampler createSampler(RandomGenerator generator); Sample createSampler(); // uses default RandomGenerator } interface Sampler { double sample(); double[] sample(int sampleSize); }
