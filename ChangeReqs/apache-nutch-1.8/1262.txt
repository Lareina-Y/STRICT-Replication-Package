Map `duplicating` content-types to a single type
Similar or duplicating content-types can end-up differently in an index. With, for example, both application/xhtml+xml and text/html it is impossible to use a single filter to select `web pages`. See also: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/application-xhtml-xml-gt-text-html-td3699942.html Content-Type mapping is disabled by default and is enabled via moreIndexingFilter.mapMimeTypes. Example mapping file is provided in conf/. {code} # target MIME-type <TAB> type1 [<TAB> type2 ...] # Map XHTML to HTML text/html application/xhtml+xml # Map XHTML and HTML to something else Web page text/html application/xhtml+xml # Map some office documents to each other Office document application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text application/x-tika-msoffice {code}
