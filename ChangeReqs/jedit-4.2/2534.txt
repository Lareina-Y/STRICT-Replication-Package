Please Test: NumPad keys after Alt+Tab window switch
How to reproduce: Be sure that you use Linux, KDE and that the "NumLock" key is on. When the jEdit window is in the foreground, press Alt+Tab (so you switch to another window, say your web browser). Then you switch back somehow (using Alt+Tab or the mouse). Then you press "/" on the numpad. Expected behaviour: "/" is inserted into the current text buffer. Actual behaviour: nothing happens. Discussion: The reason lies in the KeyEventWorkaround class. In an attempt to work around certain key-event related bugs, it also swallows some key-events. Solution: It seems that most key-event workarounds are not needed anymore (users need to have JDK 1.4 or greater). Also the KeyEventWorkaround class intermixes working around bugs and creating objects of type KeyEventTranslator.Key. A KeyEventTranslator.Key object represents a hit key, carring either character information if the key represents a character to be inserted into the current text buffer (e.g. the character 'A') or key information if the key does not represent a character to be inserted into the current text buffer. To solve the problem, I circumvented the KeyEventWorkaround class and reimplemented the generation of KeyEventTranslator.Key objects. The resulting patch is divided into two parts: (1) jedit.simplifyKeyHandling.introduce.patch: This patch just introduces the new simplified key handling, but it does not enable it. Everything works as before (including the bugs). (2) jedit.simplifyKeyHandling.enable.patch This patch just enables the simplified key handling. It may be that the second patch lets some ancient keyboard bugs reappear. If it is so, then revert the second patch and please let me know what is wrong. Thank you.
