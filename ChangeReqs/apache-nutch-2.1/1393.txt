Display consistent usage of GeneratorJob with 1.X
If we pass the generate argument to the nutch script, the Generator auto-spings into action and begins generating fetchlists. This should not be the case, instead it should print traditional usage to stdout. An example is below {code} lewis@lewis:~/ASF/nutchgora/runtime/local$ ./bin/nutch generate GeneratorJob: Selecting best-scoring urls due for fetch. GeneratorJob: starting GeneratorJob: filtering: true GeneratorJob: done GeneratorJob: generated batch id: 1339628223-1694200031 {code} All I wanted to do was get the usage params printed to stdout but instead it generated my batch willy nilly.
