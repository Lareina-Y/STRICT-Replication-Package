parsechecker and indexchecker to report protocol status
Parsechecker and indexchecker should report the protocol status when the fetch was not successful (status other than 200/ok). In case of a redirect, the protocol status contains the URL a redirect points to. Usually, this URL should be checked instead of the original one which is not indexed. The content of a redirect response is less useful (and often empty): {code} % nutch indexchecker http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/ fetching: http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/ parsing: http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/ contentType: text/html content : 301 Moved Permanently Moved Permanently The document has moved here .
