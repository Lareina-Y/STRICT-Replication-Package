Configuration properties not in sync between FetcherReducer and nutch-default.xml
FetcherReducer.java Bug: Following properties appear in FetcherReducer but not in nutch-default.xml {code} 290 useHostSettings = conf.getBoolean("fetcher.queue.use.host.settings", false); 300 this.timelimit = conf.getLong("fetcher.timelimit", -1); 450 this.byIP = conf.getBoolean("fetcher.threads.per.host.by.ip", true); 698 timelimit = context.getConfiguration().getLong("fetcher.timelimit", -1); {code} Therefore they cannot be used properly in code execution and must be updated, removed and/or added to nutch-default.xml. Patch coming up just now.
