"Set lyrics automatically" cannot be terminated
A problem can occur when I right-click on a file and select "Set lyrics automatically". If I perform that action on an obscure artist whose lyrics will not be found, the "Performing changes..." window appears and never goes away. I've literally waited for ten minutes on occasion; the lyrics are never found, and the window never closes. Since that window makes it impossible to do anything with aTunes, when this happens, I must forcefully kill the program. This would not be such a problem if there was an actual way to close the "Performing changes..." window before it finishes its task. The window has no cancel button; it _does_ have an 'X' button, but it does not actually do anything. While less frequent, I've also had perpetual "Performing changes..." windows occur while trying to do other tag-related tasks. This could be fixed either by tracking down why the "Performing changes..." window on occasion does not terminate or by adding a way for the user to close the window.
