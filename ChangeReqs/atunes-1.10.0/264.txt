Wrong song duration displayed by player
On some longer songs that I bought from Amazon, the player displays the wrong song length when the song is playing. Example - the song 49:00 by Paul Westerberg is 43:55, but when the song starts playing, the time at the bottom of the player is 86:34. The time is correct in the info dialog. Another example is "In a Silent Way" by Miles Davis. It's two songs are both about 18:00 minutes long but show up as more than 36:00 in the player. The bit rates for the songs are unusual - 252k for the Westerberg song, so maybe that confuses the player. The songs sound ok - no problem with the actual playing.
