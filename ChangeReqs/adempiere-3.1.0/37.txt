Report viewer scrolling broken
See Compiere Bug Tracker: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1468312&group_id=29057&atid=410215 Basically, the report viewer always jumps from the top of a page to the top of the next page when you attempt to scroll. If your screen is too small/ resolution too low you can never see the bottom of the page. I posted a patch to Compiere ages ago -- no response, of course. Perhaps Adempiere can do better ;) I'll post my patch over on the patch tracker, and link to it here. Let me know if its good, bad or indifferent. Regards, Paul
