Voiding/reversal of consolidated Invoices
Compiere Bug: [ 1477014 ] Generate Invoices for Consolidated Shipments http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1477014&group_id=29057&atid=410215 This bug is closely related to compiere bug http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1255772&group_id=29057&atid=410215 This is the same functional/logic issue as with the consolidated orders bug but related to consolidated Invoices. When consolidated invoiced is voided or reversed only the first order (which is referenced on the document header) is voided/reversed.
