Only due invoices in Payment Selection
Compiere bug: 1542707 Only due invoices in Payment Selection I see a problem in the window Payment Selection (manual). The "Only Due Invoices" checkbox does not function correctly for invoices with payment terms using the "Fixed Date" form. The batch version of generating Payment Selections does function correctly! I've tracked the problem down to the class org.compiere.apps.form.VPaySelect It doesn't use the oracle function paymentTermDueDate in determining the "Due Date" of the invoices (as it does in the batch version of this function). Both the SQL selection and the column display of the DueDate need to changed.
