toString() method of SequentialAccessSparseVector has excess comma at the end
Realization of SequentialAccessSparseVector toString() method had changed in MAHOUT-1259 patch. Unfortunately, that patch introduced new bug: output of the toString() method had been changed - extra comma added at the end of the string Example: Consider following sparse vector {code:java} Vector v = new SequentialAccessSparseVector(capacity); v.set(1, 0.1); v.set(3, 0.3); {code} In 0.7 v.toString() returns following string: {code:java} {1:0.1,3:0.3} {code} but in 0.8 it returns {code:java} {1:0.1,3:0.3,} {code} As you can see, there is extra comma at the end of the string.
