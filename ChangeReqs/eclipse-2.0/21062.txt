Reusing ConfigureProjectWizardMainPage for target mgmt leads to incorrect resource string in dialog
Steps to reproduce: Bring up the Site Explorer view & start the New Target site wizard. Notice that the line directly above the listbox says "Select a repository type". There should not be a reference to repositories in here. After some investigation with Mike, this appear to be caused by reusing org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.ConfigureProjectWizardMainPage for the New Target wizard. We feel that the problem could be solved by adding that resource string as a parameter to the constructor of this class.
