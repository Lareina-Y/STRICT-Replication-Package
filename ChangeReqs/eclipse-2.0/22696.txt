F1 doesn't work if Help window already open
When no Help window is already open F1 works fine, but if it's already open, subsequent F1 requests seem to be simply ignored. To see this, do the following: 1. From the Java perspective, click on the Package Explorer tab/title and press F1 2. From the popup, select one of the topics (ie, Package explorer view) 3. At this point, a Help window opens and shows the selected topic 4. Leave the Help window open 5. Go back to the Java perspective, switch to the Hierarchy view and again press F1 6. A new popup appears with a list of topics related to the Hierarchy view, but selecting one will do nothing at all 7. If you close the Help window opened during step 3 and then repeat steps 5 & 6, a Help window will appear showing the Hierarchy view related topic. Note that I'm using WSDD which is based on WSWB 2.0.1
