JFace Text Editor Leaves a Black Rectangle on Content Assist text insertion
We found a problem when migrating editors based on JFace Text from V10 to V20 (driver 20020412). We found that after inserting a selected completion proposal, from the context information popup, that causes a black rectangle to appear on top of the display. See the attached screen shot. Tracing the appearance of the rectangle down, we see the rectangle just after going in the BusyIndicator.showWhile. ---------- The rectangle appears in the execution of this ---------------- class ContextInformationPopup public void showContextInformation(final IContextInformation info, final int position) { Control control= fViewer.getTextWidget(); BusyIndicator.showWhile(control.getDisplay(), new Runnable() { public void run() { internalShowContextInfo(info, position); hideContextSelector(); } }); }
