#2732 syntax highlighting broken if commenting starts in non-visib

If you use the action "range-comment" on a selection 
whose beginning is not in the visible area, the 
syntax highlighting isn't updated until the textArea 
is scrolled.

Sorry if this is a dupe, but I have many bugs to post 
and am too lazy to check them all for dupes 
currently. :-)
